# ⌨ Editing with VS Code

The preferred way of writing your Yarn Spinner code is with the official **Yarn Spinner Visual Studio Code Extension**.

The official extension adds syntax highlight to VS Code's text editor, as well as a graph view that displays the nodes, and relationships between the nodes.

If you've never used to Visual Studio Code before, [head to their official website and install it](https://code.visualstudio.com) for your operating system and platform, and then continue to [installing-the-extension.md](installing-the-extension.md "mention").
