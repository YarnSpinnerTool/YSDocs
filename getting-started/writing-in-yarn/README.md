# ‚úç Writing in Yarn

Yarn Spinner is a tool for writers. In this section, you'll learn the syntax of Yarn, how to write Yarn scripts for use in your game. You'll also learn how to use the various tools that are available for creating your content.

You'll need an editor before you can write Yarn scripts, so we recommend checking out [editing-with-vs-code](../editing-with-vs-code/ "mention") before going too far.
