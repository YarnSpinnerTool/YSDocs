## **Welcome to YarnDonut!**

YarnDonut is an unofficial port of [**Yarn Spinner**](https://yarnspinner.dev), ** the friendly tool for writing dialogue in games.** for the Godot game engine version 4. It's easy for writers to use, and has powerful features for programmers.

YarnDonut is a dialogue system that lets you write interactive conversations in a simple, screenplay-like format, which can be loaded into your game and run.

When a conversation is running, YarnDonut sends your game **lines** of dialogue to show, **options** to let the player choose from, and **commands** to make things happen in your scene.

It's free to download and use for free and commercial games, and is open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

**YarnDonut is made up of two things:**

1. [Yarn files](tutorials/editing-yarn-scripts.md) that contain the script for your game, and;
2. The [YarnDonut framework](using-yarndonut/overview.md) for your chosen game engine or method of delivery.

**To use YarnDonut you will need:**

1. **An editor to write and edit .yarn scripts with.** We recommend using the official Yarn Spinner Visual Studio Code extension, together with Visual Studio Code.
   * You can find details on installing VS Code and the official Yarn Spinner Visual Studio Code Extension here: [editing-with-vs-code](getting-started/editing-with-vs-code/ "mention")
2. The Godot editor of version 4.1 or greater. Make sure to use the Mono version which supports C# scripts.
2. **addons/YarnDonut copied into your project** Currently, YarnDonut supports Unity, so you'll need Yarn Spinner Unity.
   * You can learn more about Yarn Spinner Unity here: [overview.md](using-yarndonut/overview.md "mention")
3. **A .yarn script (or a few of them).** These will be the narrative, or bits of narrative, that YarnDonnut uses to display and deliver your dialogue.
   * You can learn more about writing in Yarn here: [writing-in-yarn](getting-started/writing-in-yarn/ "mention")
