# Yarn Spinner 3

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/youtube-banner.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Yarn Spinner 3** is out! It's the culmination of 10 years of Yarn Spinner development, taking inspiration from how people use Yarn Spinner in wildly successful and amazing games like DREDGE, Lil' Guardsman, A Short Hike, and Demonschool.

For the development of Yarn Spinner 3, stewardship of Yarn Spinner moved from our original game development studio, [Secret Lab](http://secretlab.games/), to a whole new entity focused solely on Yarn Spinner development. It's now our primary job!

Yarn Spinner is developed in the open on GitHub, and can be purchased from the [Yarn Spinner Itch.io Store](https://yarnspinner.itch.io/) or the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/yarn-spinner-for-unity-267061).
