If you're wondering how to install the Samples: you'll find them in different places depending on how you acquired Yarn Spinner:

* if you purchased [Yarn Spinner from Itch.io](https://yarnspinner.itch.io), you can download them from the "My library" section, where you'll find a seperate `.unitypackage` for the Samples, alongside the main Unity package. Download this, and open it to install the Samples in your project.
* if you purchased [Yarn Spinner from the Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/yarn-spinner-for-unity-267061), or have download it from GitHub or OpenUPM, you can find the Samples inside the Yarn Spinner entry in the Unity Package Manager window.
