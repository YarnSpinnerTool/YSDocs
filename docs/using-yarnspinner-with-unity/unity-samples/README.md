# üéÅ Unity Samples

To help learn the features, capabilities, and implementation techniques for Yarn Spinner, we provide a number of samples with Yarn Spinner for Unity:

* Intro
* Space
* Sliced Views
* Visual Novel
* 3D Speech Bubble
* Phone Chat
* Shot Reverse Shot
* User Input and Yarn
* Markup Palettes
* Pausing the Typewriter
* Minimal Dialogue Runner

The rest of this section will eventually summarise each of these, and currently summarises the Intro Sample.

If you're wondering how to install the Samples: you'll find them in different places depending on how you acquired Yarn Spinner:

* if you purchased [Yarn Spinner from Itch.io](https://yarnspinner.itch.io), you can download them from the "My library" section, where you'll find a seperate `.unitypackage` for the Samples, alongside the main Unity package. Download this, and open it to install the Samples in your project.
* if you purchased [Yarn Spinner from the Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/yarn-spinner-for-unity-267061), or downlaoded it from GitHub or OpenUPM, you can find the Samples inside the Yarn Spinner entry in teh Unity Package Manager window.\
