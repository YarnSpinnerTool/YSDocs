# Welcome

## Getting Started

The best way to get started with Yarn Spinner, using the **Core Components**, is to work through our [**Beginner's Guide**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MUzdrP-qDd2PGa85Yan/s/-MUzduXovTOfMmBpZ0Wi/\~/changes/120/beginners-guide), which is a gentle introduction to:

1. [**Syntax Basics**](syntax-basics.md) — Using **Try Yarn Spinner** to learn the basic syntax for writing Yarn, the language for writing dialogue in Yarn scripts.&#x20;
2. [**Writing Narratives**](writing-narratives.md)  — Moving to **Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code**, and learning how to structure narratives and stories using features of the Yarn language.
3. [**Using a Game Engine**](making-a-game.md) — Using **Yarn Spinner for Unity** or **Yarn Spinner for Godot**, and integrating a Yarn script with what’s happening in the game engine, as well as one simple way of nicely displaying your dialogue in-game.
