description: The three-step beginner's guide to learning the basics of Yarn Spinner.

# Welcome

## Getting Started

The best way to get started with Yarn Spinner, using the **Core Components**, is to work through our [**Beginner's Guide**](broken-reference), which is a gentle introduction to:

1. [**Syntax Basics**](syntax-basics.md) — Using **Try Yarn Spinner** to learn the basic syntax for writing Yarn, the language for writing dialogue in Yarn scripts.
2. [**Writing Narratives**](writing-narratives.md) — Moving to **Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code**, and learning how to structure narratives and stories using features of the Yarn language.
3. [**Using a Game Engine**](making-a-game.md) — Using **Yarn Spinner for Unity**, **Yarn Spinner for Godot**, or **Yarn Spinner for Rust**, and integrating a Yarn script with what’s happening in the game engine, as well as one simple way of nicely displaying your dialogue in-game.

Unreal support is currently in [testing](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Unreal/tree/develop). Official release, along with tutorials, in late-2023. Join the [official Yarn Spinner Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yarnspinner) for news and updates, or [support us on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/secretlab). Yarn Spinner for Godot and Yarn Spinner for Rust are both experimental Yarn Labs projects.
