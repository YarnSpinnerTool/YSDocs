# Welcome

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Beginner's Guide to Yarn Spinner's **Core Components**. In this guide, you'll learn about:

1. [**Syntax Basics**](syntax-basics.md) — Using **Try Yarn Spinner** to learn the basic syntax for writing Yarn, the language for writing dialogue in Yarn scripts.
2. [**Writing Narratives**](writing-narratives.md) — Moving to **Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code**, and learning how to structure narratives and stories using features of the Yarn language.
3. [**Using a Game Engine**](making-a-game.md) — Using **Yarn Spinner for Unity**, **Yarn Spinner for Godot**, or **Yarn Spinner for Rust**, and integrating a Yarn script with what’s happening in the game engine, as well as one simple way of nicely displaying your dialogue in-game.
