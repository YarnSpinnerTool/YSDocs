# üß∂ Yarn Spinner Components

## Yarn Spinner Projects

Yarn Spinner isn't a single project, but is a collection of projects. Conceptually, we think of Yarn Spinner as having **Core Components**, some **Add-ons**, and some **Yarn Labs Experiments**.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you're new to Yarn Spinner, you don't necessarily need to understand the components just yet. We **strongly recommend** starting with [our three-step Beginner's Guide](beginners-guide/welcome.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Core Components

These are production-ready components, with stable, established, released versions:

* **Yarn**, the language you write your dialogue and narrative in: you write Yarn _scripts_.
* **Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code**, the _extension_ for the popular free text editor, Visual Studio Code, that gives it an understanding of the Yarn language, and helps you to write Yarn _scripts_.
* **Yarn Spinner for Unity**, the package you use to _import_ and _use_ your Yarn scripts in games you build in Unity.
* **Try Yarn Spinner**, an online tool that allows you to write Yarn scripts and Play them in a web browser. It's useful to write basic Yarn, and test things out. It's just a [website](https://try.yarnspinner.dev) you can visit!

{% hint style="success" %}
**Yarn Spinner for Unreal** is moving from Yarn Labs to Core Components in early-2024.
{% endhint %}

### Add-ons

These are projects that supply additional features to Yarn Spinner, and exist as add-ons to the free, open source projects that comprise the bulk of Yarn Spinner:

* **Dialogue Wheel for Yarn Spinner**, an add-on package for Yarn Spinner for Unity that provides Mass Effect-style dialogue wheel dialogue views.
* **Speech Bubbles for Yarn Spinner**, an add-on package for Yarn Spinner for Unity that provides customisable speech bubbles as dialogue views.

‚≠êÔ∏è To purchase the Add-ons, [visit the Yarn Spinner Itch.io Store](https://yarnspinner.itch.io), or the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/91946), or just [read the documentation](add-ons/about-add-ons.md).

### Yarn Labs Experiments

These are experimental projects that are likely to eventually be released, but are currently in early, or experimental stages:

* **Yarn Spinner for Unreal**, the package you use to _import_ and _use_ your _Yarn scripts_ in games you build in Unreal.
* **Yarn Spinner for Godot**, the package you use to _import_ and _use_ your _Yarn scripts_ in games you build in Godot.
* **Yarn Spinner for Rust**, the package that you use to _import_ and _use_ your _Yarn scripts_ in games you build using the Rust-based Bevy engine.
