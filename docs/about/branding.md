# How to credit Yarn Spinner

{% hint style="warning" %}
This document is a living document, and might change from time to time. Please check back occasionally!
{% endhint %}

**Thank you for using Yarn Spinner! 💚** This page contains information on how to use the Yarn Spinner name and logo in projects that make use of Yarn Spinner, or in media coverage of Yarn Spinner.

There are two parts to crediting Yarn Spinner: what you're **required** to do if you use Yarn Spinner, and, optionally, what we'd **appreciate** you doing.

This page outlines the **requirements**, the things we'd **appreciate you doing**, and **provides downloads of the Yarn Spinner logo**.

### What You're Required To Do

Yarn Spinner is provided to you under the terms of the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). This means that if you use Yarn Spinner in a game, software, or any other work, you are **required** to include a copy of Yarn Spinner's license in that work.

You can find a copy of [Yarn Spinner's license on GitHub](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/blob/main/LICENSE.md). It's also included in the packaged versions of Yarn Spinner (such as via the Unity Package Manager, and reproduced here:

**You are required to include a copy of this with your game.** There's no firm rules as to how you do this. We have some suggestions, though:

* on a screen in your game, along with other software licenses
* in a file that lists all licenses related to your game
* in an accompanying PDF, or similar, electronic manual or documentation

Basically, as long as a copy of Yarn Spinner's version of the MIT license is distributed with your game, you're good to go.

### What We'd Appreciate You Doing

In addition to including a copy of the Yarn Spinner's MIT license in your game, **we'd very much appreciate it if you include Yarn Spinner in your game's credits**, such as the initial splash screen, or in your end-game credits, or somewhere else of your choosing. Yarn Spinner is freely released, under a permissive open source license, and we appreciate you telling people that Yarn Spinner helped make your game.

If you credit Yarn Spinner, you can use the logo, a text credit, or both.

If you use a text credit, we suggest the following:

You can reword this however you'd like, but we'd prefer if you kept the name 'Yarn Spinner', and the link to the website.

Yarn Spinner® is a trademark of Secret Lab Pty. Ltd., the original creators, and is licensed to Yarn Spinner Pty. Ltd, which is a spinoff company to look after the project.

For the purposes of crediting Yarn Spinner, acknowledging that you're using Yarn Spinner, or discussing, teaching, or tutorialising Yarn Spinner and other simlar uses, we give you permission to use the Yarn Spinner name and logo on packaging, promotional/advertising materials, splash screens, in publications, seminars, conference talks, and web sites, and anything else in relation to your Yarn Spinner-powered software.

**When using the Yarn Spinner name and logo, please do your best adhere to the following general guidelines:**

1. The Yarn Spinner trademark can only be part of a product name (e.g. "Big Talk for Yarn Spinner") if it's a true reflection (i.e. the product works with Yarn Spinner).
2. The Yarn Spinner trademark can be used in a referential manner or alongside a referential phrase (e.g. "_SimOptometrist is built with Yarn Spinner_", "Aunty _Edna's Grand Adventure uses Yarn Spinner_", "_Big Talk is compatible with Yarn Spinner_", "_Bobby Yarner teaches Yarn Spinner_", "_Learn Yarn Spinner with Dr Eyeballs_");
3. The game, or project that you're including the Yarn Spinner trademark must, in fact, work with, use, or relate to Yarn Spinner in some way;
4. The use of the Yarn Spinner trademark cannot imply endorsement, sponsorhip, or an inaccurate representation of the relationship between you, your game/project, and the Yarn Spinner project, team, Yarn Spinner Pty. Ltd., or Secret Lab Pty Ltd;
5. The use of the Yarn Spinner trademark should not show Yarn Spinner, the Yarn Spinner team, Yarn Spinner Pty. Ltd., Secret Lab Pty Ltd, or any related group or entity in an false or derogatory manner, or in association with any hate speech, or criminal or illegal activities.

If you have any questons on this, ask the Yarn Spinner team in the Discord, tweet at us, or email us at legal AT yarnspinner.dev — we're friendly, and really just want to help.
