# Setting up the Unity project

## **Create a new project in Unity**

It doesn't really matter which project template you use. In this case, we've chosen the 3D template.

## Create a new Yarn Script

* Choose _Assets — Create — Yarn Script_ to create a new Yarn Script in your project's assets.

* Rename the new asset to _Intro_, using the Project pane.

* Double click the Intro script to open it in your preferred text editor. You should see an empty Yarn Script, with some placeholder material.
