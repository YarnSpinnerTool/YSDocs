# Overview

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Announce Tile@1x.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Yarn Spinner 3 has many new features. While everything that existed in Yarn Spinner 2.x should largely keep working the same way in Yarn Spinner 3, there's so many new things that we thought we'd highlight them separately!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This section of the documentation will exist while Yarn Spinner 3 is in beta, and will folded into the rest of the documentation when v3 has a full release.
{% endhint %}
