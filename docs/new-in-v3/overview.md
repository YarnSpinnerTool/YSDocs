# Overview

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Announce Tile@1x.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Yarn Spinner 3 has many new features. While everything that existed in Yarn Spinner 2.x should largely keep working the same way in Yarn Spinner 3, there's so many new things that we thought we'd highlight them separately!&#x20;

Visit [the blog post announcing Yarn Spinner 3 Beta 1 ](https://www.yarnspinner.dev/blog/yarn-spinner-3-beta-1)for more information.

Yarn Spinner 3 is currently only available for Yarn Spinner for Unity and Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code.

{% hint style="info" %}

To use Yarn Spinner 3 for Unity and Yarn Spinner 3 for Visual Studio Code, you'll need to [install it.](installing-the-beta.md)
