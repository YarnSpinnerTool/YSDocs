# Samples

### Yarn Spinner 3 ships with the following samples:

* [Welcome](intro.md) - a small scene in which a character explains Yarn Spinner's inbuilt samples and what each of the others include.
* [Feature Tour](feature-tour.md) - walks through the various major features of Yarn Spinner.
* [Theming Default Views](theming-default-views.md) - demonstrates basic customisation of dialogue views with a custom font, view background, and continue button texture.
* [Create a Phone Chat View](page-1.md) - demonstrates more elaborate customisation of dialogue views such that they are styled like a text message conversation on a phone screen. This includes how to add lines or options to the screen when a new line is received, as opposed to the default view which replaces the previous line or options.
* [Make Options That Timeout](make-options-timeout.md) - demonstrates creation of custom options view and behaviour such that the player is given only a limited amount of time to choose once dialogue options are presented.
* [Voice Over and Localisation](sample-guide-voice-over-and-localisation.md) -
* [Background Chatter](background-chatter.md) - demonstrates the use of multiple Dialogue Runners to allow different types of NPC background conversations simultaneously with each other or during primary dialogue.
* [Inline Events](inline-events.md) - demonstrates the use of Action Markup to insert command-like triggers in the middle of dialogue line delivery.
* [Replacement Markup](replacement-markup.md) - demonstrates the use of Replacement Markup to insert text styling or dynamic content into dialogue lines as they are presented.
* [Basics Storylets and Saliency](basics-storylets-and-saliency.md) - demonstrates the creation of pools of lines or nodes which can be drawn from based on current game state to deliver dynamic, contextual content.
* [Advanced Saliency](advanced-saliency.md) - demonstrates the use of node groups, line groups, and dynamic line content together to make a fully dynamic scene.
* [Custom Saliency Strategies](custom-saliency-strategies.md) - demonstrates the creation of a custom way to score and choose between content in node or line groups at runtime.
