# Storylets and Saliency

**Storylets and Saliency** are a new feature of **Yarn Spinner 3** that has quite a few different pieces to making it work. Because of this we have multiple samples dedicated to demonstrating these.

The samples are not about the **concept** of storylets and saliency, if you are new to this and wondering what this all means, then we _highly_ recommend our [storylets-and-saliency-a-primer.md](../../../write-yarn-scripts/advanced-scripting/storylets-and-saliency-a-primer.md "mention").

The samples assume you are comfortable now with both the [concepts of storylets and salient content](../../../write-yarn-scripts/advanced-scripting/saliency.md) and [writing them](../../../write-yarn-scripts/advanced-scripting/node-groups.md) in Yarn Spinner.

There are three **samples** around using storylets and saliency in Yarn Spinner for Unity:

* [basics-storylets-and-saliency.md](basics-storylets-and-saliency.md "mention") goes over the basics of using storylets in your games
* [custom-saliency-strategies.md](custom-saliency-strategies.md "mention") looks at how you can create custom saliency strategies
* [advanced-saliency.md](advanced-saliency.md "mention") demonstrates using storylets and interpolation together to build entire dynamic stories and events.
