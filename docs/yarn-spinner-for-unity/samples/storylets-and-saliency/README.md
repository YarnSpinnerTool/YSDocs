# Storylets and Saliency

Storylets and Saliency are a new feature of Yarn Spinner v3 that has quite a few different pieces to making it work.
Because of this we have multiple samples dedicated to demonstrating these.
The samples are not about the **concept** of storylets and saliency, if you are new to this and wondering what this all means there is a [guide](../../../write-yarn-scripts/advanced-scripting/storylets-and-saliency-a-primer.md) on this we *highly* recommend you check out.
The samples assume you are comfortable now with both the [concepts of storylets and salient content](../../../write-yarn-scripts/advanced-scripting/saliency.md) and [writing them](../../../write-yarn-scripts/advanced-scripting/node-groups.md) in Yarn Spinner.

There are three samples around using storylets and saliency in Yarn Spinner for Unity.
The [first](basics-storylets-and-saliency.md) goes over the basics of using storylets in your games.
Next we have [a sample](custom-saliency-strategies.md) on how you can create custom saliency strategies.
The [final sample](advanced-saliency.md) demonstrates using storylets and interpolation together to build entire dynamic stories and events.
