# ðŸš§ Welcome

The Welcome sample is the launching point for the Yarn Spinner samples.\
It doesn't cover anything in of itself, it is a quick tour of every sample.

While this isn't intended to be a sample you might be interested in checking out how the projector works as a custom dialogue presenter.
{% endhint %}

Welcome has Capsley standing in front of a projector showing slides of each sample in the package.\
Each sample is clustered into one of four categories:

* Basic
* Presenters
* Extending
* Advanced
