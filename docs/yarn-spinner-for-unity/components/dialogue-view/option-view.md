# Option View

An Option View is an object that the [Options List View](options-list-view.md) uses when presenting options. When the [Dialogue Runner](../dialogue-runner.md) delivers options to your game, Options List View will create an Option View for each option that could be selected.

When the Option View is pressed, the Options List View will notify the Dialogue Runner of the user's selection.
