This Unity package provides two prefabs: **Formal Bubble** and **Casual Bubble**. The package requires Yarn Spinner for Unity.

This add-on is not part of the open source Yarn Spinner package, and can be [purchased from the Yarn Spinner Itch.io Store](https://yarnspinner.itch.io/speech-bubbles-for-yarn-spinner):

Speech Bubbles for Yarn Spinner provides a **Casual Bubble** and a **Formal Bubble** prefab. Both are customisable, powerful, and extremely flexible:

* customise fonts, colours, and styles of bubbles
* optional character nameplate
* flexible anchor point for bubble stem
* lock bubbles to camera, or not, your choice
* works for 2D or 3D games

This guide provides documentation on using both prefabs.

The oldest supported version of Unity for the Speech Bubbles is 2021.3.
