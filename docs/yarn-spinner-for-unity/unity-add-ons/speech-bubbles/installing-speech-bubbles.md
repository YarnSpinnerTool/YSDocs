# Installing Speech Bubbles

You can purchase Speech Bubbles for Yarn Spinner from the [Yarn Spinner Itch Store](https://yarnspinnertool.itch.io) or the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/speech-bubbles-for-yarn-spinner-275933).

{% hint style="info" %}
To use the Speech Bubbles for Yarn Spinner package in Unity, you'll also need to make sure you've got the Yarn Spinner for Unity package [installed](../../../yarn-spinner-for-unity/installation-and-setup/README.md).
{% endhint %}

Once you've purchased it, download the package from the store. It will be in the form of a `.unitypackage` file. To install the package, open the Unity project that you want to add it to, and open the the Assets menu -> Import Package -> Custom Package...

You'll then be able to select the `.unitypackage` file for Speech Bubbles for Yarn Spinner on your file system, and click Open. This will present the Import Unity Package window:

Click the Import button, and Speech Bubbles for Yarn Spinner will be imported into your project.

The Speech Bubbles add-on comes has two packages inside the unitypackage, one for the speech bubbles themselves, and one for the Yarn Spinner Samples.
The samples contain necessary resources for the two speech bubble examples but if you already have the [samples installed](../../../yarn-spinner-for-unity/samples/README.md) you do not need to add them again.
