# Dialogue Wheel

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Dialogue Wheel v2 - Wide Cover.png" alt="Dialogue Wheels for Yarn Spinner. A light blue oval shape appears over a purple-lit background, with three text labels around it: &#x22;We&#x27;re in space&#x22;, &#x22;we should kiss&#x22;, and &#x22;I should go&#x22;.  &#x22;We should kiss&#x22; is highlighted."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This Unity package provides two prefabs: **Image Dialogue Wheel** and **Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel**. The package requires Yarn Spinner for Unity.

This add-on is not part of the open source Yarn Spinner package, and can be [purchased from the Yarn Spinner Itch.io Store](https://yarnspinner.itch.io/dialogue-wheel-for-yarn-spinner) or via the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/dialogue-wheels-for-yarn-spinner-276025).

Dialogue Wheel for Yarn Spinner provides an **Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel** and a **Image Dialogue Wheel** prefab. Both are customisable, powerful, and extremely flexible:

* customise fonts, colours, and styles of wheels
* enable and disable segments (Six-Segment Wheel)
* specify specific segments for specific dialogue (Six-Segment Wheel)
* theoretically unlimited options on the wheel (Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel)
* works for 2D or 3D games

This guide provides documentation on using both prefabs.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The oldest supported version of Unity for the Dialogue Wheel is 2022.3.

### Image Wheel

The Image Wheel provides a dialogue wheel with a light scif-fi appearance, and support for up to six segments, and the ability to specify exactly which of the segment positions is used for an option in your Yarn scripts.

### Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel

The Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel provides a dialogue wheel with a simple graphical appearance, and can—theoretically—support as many options as you'd like, automatically adjusting to display them. You cannot force an option to appear in a specific place on the wheel.
