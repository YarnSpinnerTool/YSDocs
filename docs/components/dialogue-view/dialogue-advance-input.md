  Presenter that the user wants to proceed to the next piece of content.

# Line Advancer

A **Line Advancer** listens for user input and sends requests to a Dialogue Runner to advance the presentation of the current line, either by asking a dialogue runner to hurry up its delivery, advance to the next line, or cancel the entire dialogue session.

A Line Advancer is generally used to implement a 'press spacebar to continue/skip' mechanic.

{% hint style="info" %}
A Line Advancer isn't a Line Presenter itself, but it's designed to work with other line presenters, to interrupt and control the flow of dialogue.
{% endhint %}

To use a Line Advancer, create a new game object, and attach a Line Advancer component to it using the Add Component button.

You can control what specific input the component is looking for by changing the Continue Action Type setting:

* If you set the **Input Mode** to **Key Code**, you can select a key on the keyboard that will continue to the next line on press, or hurry up.
* If you set the **Input Mode** to **Input Actions**, you can create an Action from an input device (such as from a keyboard, gamepad, or other method).

If you want to use Input Actions, your project will need to be set up to use the  [Unity Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.2/manual/index.html).
