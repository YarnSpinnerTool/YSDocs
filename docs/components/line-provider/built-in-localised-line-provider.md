# Built-in Localised Line Provider

The Built-in Localised Line Provider is a Line Provider that fetches localized text or audio assets (AudioClip) for a line of dialogue, given the user's language.&#x20;

The Built-in Localised Line Provider will automatically use Addressable Assets, if the Addressables package is installed in your Unity project and the [Yarn Project](../../yarn-spinner-for-unity/yarn-projects.md) is configured to use Addressable Assets.

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll automatically use this Line Provider if you are using the [Built-In Localisation](../../yarn-spinner-for-unity/assets-and-localization/inbuilt-localisation.md) system. If you are using the [Unity Localisation](../../yarn-spinner-for-unity/assets-and-localization/unity-localization.md) system, use the [Unity Localised Line Provider](unity-localised-line-provider.md) instead.
