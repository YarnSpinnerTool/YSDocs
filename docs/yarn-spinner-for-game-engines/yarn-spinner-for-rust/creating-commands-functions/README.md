# ðŸ¤– Custom Commands and Functions

* You can define your own [commands](creating-commands.md), which allow the scripts you write in Yarn Spinner to control parts of the game that you've built.
* [Functions](creating-functions.md) are units of code that Yarn scripts can call to receive a value. In addition to the [built-in functions](../../../write-yarn-scripts/syntax-basics/functions.md#built-in-functions) that come with Yarn Spinner, you can create your own.
