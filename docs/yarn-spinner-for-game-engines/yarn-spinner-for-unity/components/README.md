# ðŸ§± Components

Yarn Spinner for Unity is made up of a number of components. The most important of these are the [**Dialogue Runner**](dialogue-runner.md), which loads and runs your scripts, and the [**Dialogue Views**](dialogue-view/) that show content to your player.

In this section, you'll learn about how to work with each of these.
