# characterNameContainer

Field in [AsyncLineView](yarn.unity.asynclineview.md)

## Summary

The game object that holds the [characterNameText](yarn.unity.asynclineview.characternametext.md) text field.

```csharp
public GameObject? characterNameContainer = null;
```

## Remarks

This is needed in situations where the character name is contained within an entirely different game object. Most of the time this will just be the same game object as [characterNameText](yarn.unity.asynclineview.characternametext.md) .
