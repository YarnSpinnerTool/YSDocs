# AsyncLineView.characterNameContainer

Field in [AsyncLineView](/docs/api/csharp/yarn.unity.asynclineview.md)

## Summary


The game object that holds the  <a href="yarn.unity.asynclineview.characternametext.md">characterNameText</a>  text
field.


```csharp
public GameObject? characterNameContainer = null;
```

## Remarks


This is needed in situations where the character name is contained
within an entirely different game object. Most of the time this will
just be the same game object as  <a href="yarn.unity.asynclineview.characternametext.md">characterNameText</a> .
