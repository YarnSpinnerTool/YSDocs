# StringInfo.isImplicitTag

Field in [StringInfo](/api/csharp/yarn.compiler.stringinfo.md)

## Summary


Indicates whether this string's line ID was implicitly
generated.


```csharp
public bool isImplicitTag;
```

## Remarks


Implicitly generated line IDs are not guaranteed to remain the
same across multiple compilations. To ensure that a line ID
remains the same, you must define it by adding a line tag to the
line.
