# Dialogue.Continue()

Method in [Dialogue](/api/csharp/yarn.dialogue.md)

## Summary


Starts, or continues, execution of the current Program.


```csharp
public void Continue()
```

## Remarks

<p>
This method repeatedly executes instructions until one of the
following conditions is encountered:
</p> <ul type="bullet">
<li>The <a href="yarn.dialogue.linehandler.md">LineHandler</a> or <a href="yarn.dialogue.commandhandler.md">CommandHandler</a>
is called. After calling either of these handlers, the Dialogue will
wait until <a href="yarn.dialogue.continue.md">Continue()</a> is called. Continue may be called
from inside the <a href="yarn.dialogue.linehandler.md">LineHandler</a> or <a href="yarn.dialogue.commandhandler.md">CommandHandler</a>, or may be called at any future time.</li>
<li>The <a href="yarn.dialogue.optionshandler.md">OptionsHandler</a> is called. When this occurs,
the Dialogue is waiting for the user to specify which of the options
has been selected, and <a href="yarn.dialogue.setselectedoption.md">SetSelectedOption(int)</a> must be
called before <a href="yarn.dialogue.continue.md">Continue()</a> is called again.)</li>
<li>The Program reaches its end. When this occurs, <a href="yarn.dialogue.setnode.md">SetNode(string)</a> must be called before <a href="yarn.dialogue.continue.md">Continue()</a> is called again.</li>
<li>An error occurs while executing the Program.</li>
</ul> <p>This method has no effect if it is called while the <a href="yarn.dialogue.md">Dialogue</a> is currently in the process of executing
instructions.</p>
