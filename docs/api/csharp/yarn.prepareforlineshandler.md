# PrepareForLinesHandler

Delegate in [Yarn](yarn.md)

Inherits from `System.MulticastDelegate`

## Summary

Represents the method that is called when the dialogue anticipates that\
it will deliver lines.

```csharp
public delegate void PrepareForLinesHandler(IEnumerable<string> lineIDs);
```

## Remarks

This method should begin preparing to run the lines. For example, if a\
game delivers dialogue via voice-over, the appropriate audio files\
should be loaded.

This method serves to provide a hint to the game that a line \_may\_ be\
run. Not every line indicated in `lineIDs` may end up\
actually running.

This method may be called any number of times during a dialogue session.
