# DialogueCharacterNameView

Class in [Yarn.Unity](yarn.unity.md)

Inherits from [`DialogueViewBase`](yarn.unity.dialogueviewbase.md)

## Summary

A subclass of [DialogueViewBase](yarn.unity.dialogueviewbase.md) that displays character names.

```csharp
public class DialogueCharacterNameView : Yarn.Unity.DialogueViewBase
```

## Remarks

This class uses the `character` attribute on lines that it receives to determine its content. When the view's [RunLine(LocalizedLine,Action)](yarn.unity.dialoguecharacternameview.runline.md) method is called with a line whose [Text](yarn.unity.localizedline.text.md) contains a `character` attribute, the [onNameUpdate](yarn.unity.dialoguecharacternameview.onnameupdate.md) event is fired. If the line does not contain such an attribute, the [onNameNotPresent](yarn.unity.dialoguecharacternameview.onnamenotpresent.md) event is fired instead.

This view does not present any options or handle commands. It's intended to be used alongside other subclasses of DialogueViewBase.
