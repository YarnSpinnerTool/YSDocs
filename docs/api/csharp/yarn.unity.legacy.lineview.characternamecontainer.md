Field in [LineView](yarn.unity.legacy.lineview.md)

## Summary

The gameobject that holds the [characterNameText](yarn.unity.legacy.lineview.characternametext.md)\
textfield.

```csharp
public GameObject? characterNameContainer = null;
```

## Remarks

This is needed in situations where the character name is contained\
within an entirely different game object. Most of the time this will\
just be the same gameobject as [characterNameText](yarn.unity.legacy.lineview.characternametext.md) .
