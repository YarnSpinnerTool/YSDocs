# LineView.characterNameContainer

Field in [LineView](/docs/api/csharp/yarn.unity.legacy.lineview.md)

## Summary


The gameobject that holds the  <a href="yarn.unity.legacy.lineview.characternametext.md">characterNameText</a> 
textfield.


```csharp
public GameObject? characterNameContainer = null;
```

## Remarks


This is needed in situations where the character name is contained
within an entirely different game object. Most of the time this will
just be the same gameobject as  <a href="yarn.unity.legacy.lineview.characternametext.md">characterNameText</a> .
