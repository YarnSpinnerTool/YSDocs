# AddCommandHandler(string,MethodInfo)

Method in [DialogueRunner](yarn.unity.dialoguerunner.md)

## Summary

Adds a command handler. Dialogue will pause execution after the command is called.

```csharp
public void AddCommandHandler(string commandName, MethodInfo method);
```

## Remarks

When this command handler has been added, it can be called from your Yarn scripts like so:

```
<<commandName param1 param2>>
```

If `handler` is a method that returns a `UnityEngine.Coroutine`, when the command is run, the [DialogueRunner](yarn.unity.dialoguerunner.md) will wait for the returned coroutine to stop before delivering any more content.

If `handler` is a method that returns an `System.Collections.IEnumerator`, when the command is run, the [DialogueRunner](yarn.unity.dialoguerunner.md) will start a coroutine using that method and wait for that coroutine to stop before delivering any more content.
