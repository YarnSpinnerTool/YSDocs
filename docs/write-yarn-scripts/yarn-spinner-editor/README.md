# Yarn Spinner Editor

Back in the [Beginner's Guide](../../beginners-guide.md), you learned the basics of Yarn Spinner Scripting by using our online tool, Try Yarn Spinner.&#x20;

While Try Yarn Spinner is great for the basics, and for experimenting, when you start creating more complex narratives, you need a great editor! It's time to meet **Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code**.

## Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code

Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code is an extension for the free text editor, Visual Studio Code ("VS Code").&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Visual Studio Code is a powerful, flexible, open source code editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports extensions, which allow it to perform a wide range of useful tasks. The Yarn Spinner Extension is one of these.
{% endhint %}

If you've never used to VS Code before, [head to their official website and install it](https://code.visualstudio.com) for your operating system and platform before continuing.&#x20;

If you're already familiar with VS Code and VS Code extensions, you can just install the extension `secretlab.yarn-spinner`, or click [here](vscode:extension/SecretLab.yarn-spinner) and hit the install button, and you'll be ready to go.
{% endhint %}

Don't be too alarmed by the AI-powered nonsense Microsoft will try and sell you. You can disable most of the AI "features" via the Command Palette by pressing Shift + Command + P (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux), or choosing the View menu -> Command Palette..., and typing `Chat: Hide Copilot` and hitting Return/Enter:
