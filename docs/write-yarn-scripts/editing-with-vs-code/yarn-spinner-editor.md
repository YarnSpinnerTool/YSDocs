# Yarn Spinner Editor

To write and edit Yarn Spinner Scripts you will be using the **Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code**. Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code is an extension for the free text editor, Visual Studio Code (VS Code).&#x20;

Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code gives you syntax highlighting, as well as a graph view that displays the nodes, and relationships between the nodes, and a whole bunch of other useful features that we'll be exploring as we learn the Fundamentals.
