# Scripting Fundamentals

If you're here, you've worked through the [try-yarn-spinner.md](../../try-yarn-spinner.md "mention"), and setup the [yarn-spinner-editor](../yarn-spinner-editor/ "mention"), and you're ready to dive into the details of writing dialogue with Yarn Spinner.

This section of the documentation will take you through the scripting fundamentals:

* combining Nodes, Lines, Options, and Jumps for simple interactive narratives
* using Detours, Variables, and Yarn Spinner's Flow Control features for more complex interactions
* the basics of Commands and Functions in Yarn Spinner
* running options Once, and Line Groups for flexibility and control

Once you've completed it, you can move to [editing-with-vs-code](../syntax-basics/editing-with-vs-code/ "mention").
