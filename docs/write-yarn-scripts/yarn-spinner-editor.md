# Yarn Spinner Editor

Back in the Beginner's Guide, you learned the basics of Yarn Spinner Scripting by using our online tool, Try Yarn Spinner. Try Yarn Spinner is great for the basics, and for experimenting, but when you start creating more complex narratives, you need a great editor: Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code.

## Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code

Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code is an extension for the free text editor, Visual Studio Code ("VS Code"). Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code gives you **syntax highlighting** for Yarn Spinner Scripts, as well as a **graph view** that displays the nodes, and relationships between the nodes, and a whole bunch of **other useful features** that we'll be exploring as we learn the Fundamentals.
