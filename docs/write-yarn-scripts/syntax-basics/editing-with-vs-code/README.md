{% hint style="warning" %}
The Fundamentals are designed to be read after the [Beginner's Guide](../../try-yarn-spinner.md), or when you've already used Yarn Spinner a little bit.&#x20;

In this section, we'll learn the Fundamentals of writing narratives and game logic using Yarn Spinner. This section is intended to serve as a long-term reference you can check back to, as well as a step-by-step guide. If this is your first time, you should work through it from the beginning.
