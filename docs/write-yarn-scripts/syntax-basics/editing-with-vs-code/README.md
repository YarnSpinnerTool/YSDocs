In this section, we'll learn the Fundamentals of writing narratives and game logic using Yarn Spinner. This section is intended to serve as a long-term reference you can check back to, as well as a step-by-step guide. If this is your first time, you should work through it from the beginning.

### In this section, you will learn:

* how to use Visual Studio Code for editing Yarn Spinner Scripts
* combining Nodes, Lines, Options, and Jumps for simple interactive narratives
* using Detours, Variables, and Yarn Spinner's Flow Control features for more complex interactions
* the basics of Commands and Functions in Yarn Spinner
* running options Once, and Line Groups for flexibility and control
