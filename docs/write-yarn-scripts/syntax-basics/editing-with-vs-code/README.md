# Advanced Scripting

If you're here, you've worked through the [try-yarn-spinner.md](../../try-yarn-spinner.md "mention"), setup the [yarn-spinner-editor](../../yarn-spinner-editor/ "mention"), and learned the [scripting-fundamentals](../../scripting-fundamentals/ "mention") of Yarn Spinner.

Now it's time to look at some more advanced features, including:

* Node Groups, Storylets, and Saliency, for complex, responsive storytelling with Yarn Spinner
* Tags and Metadata, to give you flexibility on how your lines are handled in a game engine
* Markup, for providing hints on how narrative text should be displayed, as well as running commands in a game engine within lines
* Shadow Lines, for marking when a line is an identical duplicate of another line
* Writing Together, using the Live Share Extension for Visual Studio Code.

Once you've completed it, you're ready to use Yarn Spinner with a game engine, such as [Broken link](broken-reference "mention").
