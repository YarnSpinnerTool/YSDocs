Speech Bubbles for Yarn Spinner provides a **Casual Bubble** and a **Formal Bubble** prefab. Both are customisable, powerful, and extremely flexible:

* customise fonts, colours, and styles of bubbles
* optional character nameplate
* flexible anchor point for bubble stem
* lock bubbles to camera, or not, your choice
* works for 2D or 3D games

This guide provides documentation on using both prefabs.
