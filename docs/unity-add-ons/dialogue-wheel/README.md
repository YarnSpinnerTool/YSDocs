# Dialogue Wheel

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Dialogue Wheels - Banner.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This Unity package provides two prefabs: **Six-Segment Dialogue Wheel** and **Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel**. The package requires Yarn Spinner for Unity.

This add-on is not part of the open source Yarn Spinner package, and can be [purchased from the Yarn Spinner Itch.io Store](https://yarnspinner.itch.io/dialogue-wheel-for-yarn-spinner):

Dialogue Wheel for Yarn Spinner provides an **Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel** and a **Six-Segment Dialogue Wheel** prefab. Both are customisable, powerful, and extremely flexible:

* customise fonts, colours, and styles of wheels
* enable and disable segments (Six-Segment Wheel)
* specify specific segments for specific dialogue (Six-Segment Wheel)
* theoretically unlimited options on the wheel (Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel)
* works for 2D or 3D games

This guide provides documentation on using both prefabs.

The oldest supported version of Unity for the Dialogue Wheel is 2021.3.

### Six-Segment Dialogue Wheel

The Six-Segment Dialogue Wheel provides a dialogue wheel with a light scif-fi appearance, and support for up to six segments, and the ability to specify exactly which of the segment positions is used for an option in your Yarn scripts.

### Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel

The Automatic-Layout Dialogue Wheel provides a dialogue wheel with a simple graphical appearance, and can—theoretically—support as many options as you'd like, automatically adjusting to display them. You cannot force an option to appear in a specific place on the wheel.
