{% hint style="info" %}
You can purchase these add-ons at [the Yarn Spinner Itch Store](https://yarnspinnertool.itch.io). Purchasing Yarn Spinner, or a Yarn Spinner Add-on is a fantastic way to help support Yarn Spinner, and the team behind it.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Yarn Spinner is always free and open source. To help offset the costs of designing, building, and supporting Yarn Spinner, we provide a number of add-ons as paid extras to make implementing Yarn Spinner in your games easier for you.

At the moment, these include:

* [Dialogue Wheel for Yarn Spinner](dialogue-wheel/)
* [Speech Bubbles for Yarn Spinner](speech-bubbles/)

You can purchase both of these on the [Yarn Spinner Itch.io Store](https://yarnspinner.itch.io), or via [the Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/91946):
